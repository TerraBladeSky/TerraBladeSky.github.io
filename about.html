          <h3>From Carpenter to Contractor</h3>
          <p>Founded in 1998 by During Dela Cruz, DDC Homes began as a one-man carpentry service operating from a small workshop in Valenzuela. Armed with traditional craftsmanship skills passed down through generations and an unwavering commitment to quality, During started by taking on small repair jobs and custom furniture pieces for neighbors.</p>
          
          <p>What set us apart from the beginning was our attention to detail and our belief that every project, no matter how small, deserved the same level of care and precision. Word spread quickly through the community about the young carpenter who treated every home as if it were his own.</p>
          
          <p>By 2000, we had grown from a solo operation to a small team of skilled craftsmen, each sharing the same passion for excellence that During embodied. This growth wasn't just about taking on more projects—it was about building a reputation that would become the foundation of everything we do today.</p>
